Study design:
Statin vs no chol drug for at least 3 years
5-year risk of type-2 diabetes
Study period: 2010-2018

Index date: 
statin group: First date of statin
non-statin group: median of the index dates of statin group

Statin cohort
- Find patients with statin
- Find their first date of statin. This will be considered as the index date and create a new column index date
- Apply exclusions
- -- Not FV patient: (one BP at least 1 year before and 1 BP at least 1 year after index date)
- -- Missing data: no age (birth_dt), sex, 
- --               no a1c -1 yr to 0 yr before index date
- -- Diabetes med, a1c > 6.5, t2dm dx code before index date
- -- first statin dt < 2011 [no reliable data before 2010]
- -- age <= 18

Control cohort
- index date will be set as the median index dt of the statin cohort
- Apply exclusions
- -- Not FV patient: (one BP at least 1 year before and 1 BP at least 1 year after index date)
- -- Missing data: no age (birth_dt), sex, 
- --               no a1c -1 yr to 0 yr before index date
- -- Diabetes med, a1c > 6.5, t2dm dx code before index date
- -- Pt on any cholesterol drug before index date
- -- Pt on any cholesterol drug between 0 and 3 years after index date
- -- age <= 18

Follow-up
- last follow-up date = min( max(date of SBP) after index date, death dt)
- Exclude:
- -- last follow-up date < index date + 3 years [we cannot ensure that the pt did not take chol. drug]

Extract outcome
- t2dm diagnosis and max(a1c) between 0 and 5 years after index date
- determine outcome status
- -- case: has max(a1c) > 6.5 or diagnosis code between 0 and 5 years after index date
- -- control: has last follow-up date > 5 years after index date without DM
- -- censored: last follow-up date between 0 and 5 years after index date and no sign of t2dm

Extract predictor:
- age at index date
- sex
- for 0 to 2 years before index date:
- -- cholesterol: for ldl, tg: max() and last(); for hdl: min() and last()
- -- HL diagnosis yes/no; [cholesterol medication is NO]
- -- blood pressure: for sbp, dbp, pulse: max() and last()
- -- HTN diagnosis yes/no; anti-HTN medication: number of subclasses
- -- BMI: max(), avg(), last()
- -- Dx of obesity or dx of overweight

Create the design matrix
- Pick your lab aggregation (min, max, last, avg)
- Pick your outcome encoding (time-to-event, binary)

Check for missing values
- Are they informative?
- -- impute; add missing indicator if informative
- Is there sign of missing not at random (MNAR)? -> Limitations
